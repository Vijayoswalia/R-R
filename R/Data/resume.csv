The data collected by these smart meters was provided to CSE for data analytics and to find out its various research and industrial applications. It was anticipated that consumption pattern will help domestic and commercial organization in dropping their bills and hence forth reducing carbon footprints. In this project we have focused on electricity consumption done in 50,000 households during World Cup Football in U.K. This analysis helped in improving the forecasting methods of electricity consumption. I have used regression analysis, ARIMA, Principal component analysis and time series analysis in this project."
